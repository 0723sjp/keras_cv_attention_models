  num_classes: number of classes to classify images into. Set `0` to exclude top layers.
  activation: activation used in whole model, default `gelu`.
  drop_connect_rate: is used for [Deep Networks with Stochastic Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382).
      Can be a constant value like `0.2`,
      or a tuple value like `(0, 0.2)` indicates the drop probability linearly changes from `0 --> 0.2` for `top --> bottom` layers.
      A higher value means a higher probability will drop the deep branch.
      or `0` to disable (default).
  layer_scales: int or list of int, indicates layer scale init value for each stack. Default `[0, 0, 1e-6, 1e-6]`, 0 for not using.
      [Going deeper with Image Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17239).
  classifier_activation: A `str` or callable. The activation function to use on the "top" layer if `num_classes > 0`.
      Set `classifier_activation=None` to return the logits of the "top" layer.
      Default is `None`.
  pretrained: one of `None` (random initialization) or 'imagenet21k-ft1k' (pre-training on ImageNet21k and fine-tuned ImageNet).
      Will try to download and load pre-trained model weights if not None.

Returns:
    A `keras.Model` instance.
